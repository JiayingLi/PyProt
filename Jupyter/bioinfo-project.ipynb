    "# 1 - Sequence alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic material such as DNA and proteins comes in sequences made up of different blocks. The study of these sequences and their correlation is invaluable to the field of biology. Since genetic material is likely to mutate over time, it is not easy to be certain of these correlations in most cases. In order to know if two or more sequences have a common origin, we must examine their similarity in a formal way, and be able to quantify it. Since the modifications of the sequences can introduce new blocks as well as delete some, the first step to comparing sequences is aligning them by making the similar regions match. Even then, high levels of similarity do not necessarily imply a common ancestor exists (homology). Our goal in this section is to create a tool that allows us to perform such alignments and give a numeric value of the chance of homology.\n",

    "Now that the easy part is done, we need to remember why we're here (it's sequence alignment, just in case). We can align two sequences any number of ways, but we're only interested in alignments that could represent two descendants of the same original sequence. Therefore, we need to assign a **score** value to each alignment, that will help us see how significative it is.\n",

    "Because of the way mutations happen, all modifications should not be treated equally. Some amino acids are more related between them than others, therefore making them more likely to mutate into each other. Some changes are more or less likely to happen because of the very structure of the protein. Also, when an amino acid is inserted into or deleted from a sequence (thus creating a **gap** in the alignment), it usually is not the only one. This tells us that, not only should the score of the alignment depend on each pair that's aligned (meaning, on the same location), but it should also depend on how many gaps there are and how big they are.\n",

Wunsch are people who came up with a clever algorithm for aligning sequences. It provides us with the alignments that get the best score, given certain conditions. It uses a scoring system like the one we've just covered, with a few twists. In order to achieve that, it creates a matrix with enough rows to fit one sequence and enough columns to fit the other : each square represents a possible alignment between two amino acids (one from each sequence). Then, it goes through every square in the matrix and decides whether a good alignment would go that way or not. In order to dertermine that it calculates\n",
